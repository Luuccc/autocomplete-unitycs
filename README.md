The list of entries found HERE were gathered by a messy Python web scraper of mine. Scraping from the [Unity Scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/) classes section. Which may have resulted in a few incorrect entries.

Using [atom-autocomplete-boilerplate](https://github.com/lonekorean/atom-autocomplete-boilerplate) as a base.
